// Package ingest is the transport-agnostic core that receives a producer
// result — from the API or the pipeline queue — and runs the right ordered,
// idempotent sequence of actions for its kind.
//
// "Service" here means a package, not a process: there is no new microservice,
// deployment, queue or network hop. The package is compiled *into* both the
// hub-api and the analyser binaries; each calls Ingest(...) in-process on its
// own request. The package is deliberately infra-free — it only depends on
// types already in the models module and on the sink interfaces declared here,
// so it stays a fast, testable library. Concrete persistence (the Mongo
// upsert, region promotion) is supplied by each app through the Scope sinks.
//
// Routing happens on two independent axes that must not be conflated:
//
//   - Kind  (the operation) — what is this result? detection vs anpr vs
//     thumbnail vs sprite. Different shapes, different sinks, different action
//     sequences. Routed here, by the handlers registry.
//   - Task  (within a kind) — which flavour? box / pose inside detection. All
//     tasks of a kind share one contract and one collection. Routed *inside*
//     the kind handler (see detection.go). A producer whose result has a
//     genuinely different shape (e.g. anpr: recognised text, not boxes) is its
//     own kind, not a task.
